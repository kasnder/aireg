It is our enormous pleasure to welcome you here on this website about the future of AI regulation.

The roots of this project lie somewhere between London, Oxford and Venice.

In March 2022, members of the University of Oxford and Goodenough College met in Venice to discuss their ideas about the regulation of AI.

In the following weeks, we will share their thoughts with you.

Tess and Konrad
